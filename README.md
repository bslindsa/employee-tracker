## Description

This application takes the employee database given and can create, read, update, and delete from it. It has the functionality to view all departments, roles, and employees in the database, and it can view employees separately by department and managers. Different departments, roles, and employees can be added to the database. An employee's role and manager can be updated once they are entered into the system. Any department, role, or employee can also be deleted from the system. Roles and departments have a cascading setting that will cause all roles in the department to also be deleted, as well as any employees in a role that has been deleted. Be sure to update employee roles as desired before deleting any roles or departments. There is also a function to view utilized budgets by department.
